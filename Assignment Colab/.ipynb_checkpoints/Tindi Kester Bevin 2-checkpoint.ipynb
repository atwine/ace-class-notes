The best model for this data set is the GaussianNB model which coincides with previous claims that it works best for real world data. An MCC OF 1.0 indicates a perfect agreement between actuals and predictions. Thus we would expect that KNeighborsClassifier and RandomForestClassifier would perform the best at prediction.
