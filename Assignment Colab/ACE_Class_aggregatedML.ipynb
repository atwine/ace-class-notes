While EDA is a precursor to modeling, it’s also useful on its own, and many data science problems can be solved solely through the plots and statistics we made here.\n\n<h2>Establish Benchmarks<h2>\n<h2>Metrics<h2>\n\n<h4>One of the most overlooked aspects of the machine learning pipeline is establishing a baseline. Yes, it might look impressive if your classification model achieves 99% accuracy, but what if we could get 98% accuracy just by guessing the same class every time? Would we really want to spend our time building a model for that problem? A good baseline allows us to assess whether or not our model (or any model) is applicable to the task.\n\nFor regression, a good naive baseline is simply to guess the median value of the target for every observation in the test data. In our problem, the median is 0, so let’s assess the accuracy of a model that naively predicts 0 for every entry on the test set. We will use 2 metrics to evaluate predictions:\n* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute value of the differences between the predictions and true values.\n* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of the squared differences between the predictions and true values.\n\nThe mean absolute error is easily interpretable, as it represents how far off we are on average from the correct value. The root mean squared error penalizes larger errors more heavily and is commonly used in regression tasks. Either metric may be appropriate depending on the situation and we will use both for comparison<h4>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate mae and rmse\ndef evaluate_predictions(predictions, true):\n    mae = np.mean(abs(predictions - true))\n    rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions - true) ** 2))\n    \n    return mae, rmse","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n<h2>Naive Baseline<h2>\n\n<h4>For a such task, a simple naive baseline is to guess the median value on the training set for all testing cases.

Most of the work — and most of the value — comes in obtaining, cleaning, and exploring the data. Only once we have a firm grasp on the structure of our data and the relationships within it should we proceed to building machine learning models. I wanted to show the entire process in for this project to demonstrate a typical data science workflow. \nIn this project we:\n* Explored the data to find interesting patterns, trends, or anomalies\n* Examined correlations between the features and the target\n* Performed feature selection using correlation values\n* Established a baseline and benchmarked machine learning models<h4>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
